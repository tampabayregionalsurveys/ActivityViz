# ActivityViz 
ActivityViz is an interactive travel and activity data visualization tool.  It is built with JavaScript technologies 
and works with various types of travel and activity data - household travel surveys, trip-based
model outputs, activity-based model outputs, disaggregate passive data, freight models, on-board surveys, etc.  

The dashboard features several interactive and customizable visualizations for exploring data, such as 3D maps of 
trips in time and space, time use by person type and activity, radar charts for performance measure analysis, 
sunburst diagrams for visualizing mode shares, animated bubble maps, chord diagrams for OD data, point-of-interest maps for
transit stop data, truck flow data, etc.  ActivityViz is published using GitHub pages which eliminates most of the 
administrative backend in traditional systems.  This improved deployment strategy makes maintenance much easier 
for data science users.

ActivityViz was initially funded by the [Atlanta Regional Commission](https://atlantaregional.org/) (ARC), with additional
support from [Oregon Metro](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/) and others.

2. To make contributions, fork the repo, make revisions, and issue a pull request to develop.
3. Once contributions are acceptable, then we will merge develop to master and then master to gh-pages

# Adding a New Region or New Scenario Data

ActivityViz supports configuration for multiple regions.  To setup ActivityViz in your region:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Edit `config.json` for the desired region and data locations
3. Data locations can be stored local to the repository or online
    - Examples for a region named "rsginc":
        - Local: `"datalocation": "/data/rsginc/"`
        - Via GitHub: `"datalocation": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RSGInc/ActivityViz_data/master/data/rsginc/"`
4. The first region will determine which graphics are shown on the main page.
5. Copy an existing region.json file into the region folder.

## Adding New Scenario Data

Each region supports data for multiple scenarios.  Do the following to add scenario data:

1. Create a new folder in the region specific folder with the scenario name
2. Copy in the data tables that supply the data for the visualizations, each with the following set of fields:
  - BarChartAndMapData.csv: ZONE, COUNTY, <BAR_LABEL>, QUANTITY  
  - 3DAnimatedMapData.csv: ZONE, PERIOD, QUANTITY
  - TreeMapData.csv: GROUP1, GROUP2, GROUP3, ..., QUANTITY
  - RadarChartsData.csv: AXIS, CHART, <QUANTITY_1_LABEL>, <QUANTITY_2_LABEL>, ...
  - BarChartData.csv: BARGROUP, COLUMNS, QUANTITY, CHART 
  - ChordData.csv: FROM, TO, <QUANTITY_1_LABEL>, <QUANTITY_2_LABEL>, ... 
  - Scatter.csv: LABEL, XAXIS, YAXIS, SIZE (YAXIS/XAXIS)
  - PointofInterest.csv: POINTS OF INTEREST, FILTER, LAT, LNG, GROUPING, <QUANTY_1_LABEL>, <QUANTY_2_LABEL>, ...
  - TimeUseData.csv: GROUP, TIME PERIOD, PURPOSE, QUANTITY

Notes:   
  - All data tables are not required and each data table is used to populate a specific visual.  Take 
a look at the example data tables to see how each visual is constructed based on the data.  Most of the 
visuals are populated based by what is in the data tables, thereby making the visuals highly customizable.  
  - Avoid special characters such as space, slash, etc. in table data (column names and data entries).
  - TimeUse: The PERIOD entries for TimeUse and 3DAnimatedMap are 1 to 48 and represent 30 minute periods 
from 3am to 3am the next day.  The TimeUse purposes must be ALLCAPS and must include at least HOME, WORK, 
SCHOOL.  TimeUse must also include an ALL person types.
  
## Data/Region Folder

Each Data/Region folder needs the following:

1. region.json - Region specific config file:
    - Title: Title that shows up in tab of web page
    - CountyFile: Name of the geojson file with region counties

        - title: the sub text or title of the scenario that will appear along with the name on the front page
        - CenterMap: overrides the region specific center of map, will also focus in on the point rather than find best view
        - label: overrides the default scenario - title setup for the scenario and instead displays the label text in all cases
        - ScenarioFocus: filename of GeoJSON to be displayed on the maps (BarChart with Map, Point of Interest and Chord Map)
        - visualizations: set of visuals to be display on the scenario specific page, the order they are defined will determine the order of the tab
            - visuals are Sunburst, 3DMap, GroupedCharts (standard barcharts), TimeUse, RadarCharts, BarMap (barchart with map), Chord, and POIMap (barchart with POIs instead of zones)
            - Each visual title allows for an array of multiple charts. Each entry will be it's own tab on the scenario specific page.
            - Each chart object requires a "name", "config" (name of configuration set to use) and a "file" (filename that will contain the data).
            - `explanation` Optional - JSON object which configures an explanatory panel to the left of the visual (see [Visualization Explanations](#visualization-explanations) below).
            - Optional chart properties: "info" - is is a tooltip to appear next to the chart title, "datafilecolumns" - a key/value object that will display underneath the data table on the bottom of the chart tab
            - Example of multiple visuals for single chart type:  "GroupedCharts": [{"name":"GroupedCharts","config":"Default", "file":"BarChartData.csv"},{"name":"GroupedCharts2","config":"Default", "file":"BarChartData2.csv"}],
    - Each chart type has a different entry for their specific configuration settings. You can set up several different configuration entries for each chart type. This lets you customize the each chart tab
        The property entry is the name of the configuration, each chart needs to have at a minimum an empty (example: "BarMap": { "Default": {}  } ) configuration.

### Visualization Explanations

Each `visualization` object supports an `explanations` property. This property is a list of `Explanation` objects.

#### `Explanation`

| Property | Type               |
| :------- | :----------------- |
| `header` | `string`           |
| `body`   | `ContentSection[]` |

The `header` property populates a header at the top of the explanation. The `body` property is the contents of the explanation - it is a list of `ContentSection`s

#### `ContentSection`

| Property  | Type            |
| :-------- | :-------------- |
| `type`    | `string (enum)` |
| `content` | `string[]`      |

The `type` property may be one of the following:

- `"paragraph"` - creates a list of paragraphs of the strings in content
- `"orderedList"` - creates a numbered list of the strings in `content`
- `"unorderedList"` - creates a bulleted list of the strings in `content

Example of how this would look in the demo RSG BarMap visualization:

```json
{
  "BarMap": [
    {
      "name": "Daily Truck Trips",
      "file": "BarChartAndMapData.csv",
      "config": "Default",
      "info": "Truck trips by zone and county",
      "explanation": [
        {
          "header": "Explanation",
          "body": [
            {
              "type": "orderedList",
              "content": ["one li", "two li", "red li", "blue li"]
            },
            {
              "type": "unorderedList",
              "content": ["one li", "two li", "red li", "blue li"]
            },
            {
              "type": "paragraph",
              "content": ["one p", "two p", "red p", "blue p"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
